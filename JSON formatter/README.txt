Ever downloaded a swagger file and the structure is all messed up? Maybe the entire thing is in ONE SINGLE ROW?
Well, I have... Plenty of times... This is the result of that annoying problem.

1. Put file you want to format in the same folder as script. MUST be a .json file

2. Rename file to fixme.json

3. Run script

After script runs, a new file should pop up with the name "formatted_yymmdd-hhmmss.json"

Sample files provided in the folder to show how it can convert a fugly file to a pretty file.
