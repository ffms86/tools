# Tools
Small collection of tools made with Python

# 1. Password generator
Simple little password generator to create lots of passwords in a short time. Easy to use and implement in existing scripts.

# 2. Template maker
Takes a file of your choice, copies it, and sets the name you type into the window.

# 3. REST API app (PythonMan)
Super lightweight RESP API app. When Postman and the others is overkill, and all you want to do is do simple REST calls. Header and body can be loaded from files, and responses can be saved in a JSON file as well.
